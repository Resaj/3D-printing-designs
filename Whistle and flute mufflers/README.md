# Whistle and flute mufflers

Have you ever felt the urge to play the flute at 3 a.m. only to be prevented from doing so by social conventions and an extremely irritable neighbor?

Have you bought so many flutes that you can't afford a hyper-exclusive flute-shaped MIDI keyboard with limited functions?

Or has your mother simply threatened to throw you out of the house if you ever play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" again?

If you have felt identified, you're in luck! Here's the solution to all your problems! The most supportive invention since the nut and bolt! FLUTE AND WHISTLE MUFFLERS! Play until your brains come out of your ears without waking your cat!
